On my fourteenth birthday, my father told me that the weekend 
of Thanksgiving we would be going deer hunting. He had been 
telling me since I was a little boy about how wonderful it 
was to be out in the forest stalking wild game, and that it 
was a “Right of Passage” for every boy if he was to become a man. 
I never understood what he was talking about. He would go on for hours at a time, 
speaking of how he grew up on a farm and that his father hunted to put food on the table. 
He smiled as he spoke of his father, telling me how special the man had been. I could always 
hear the reverence my father had in his voice whenever he spoke of my grandfather. | © Timothy Reilly
