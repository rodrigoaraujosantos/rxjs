Early in the morning, Wallace, Meg’s husband, went up a ladder to 
the rooftop to remove a bird’s nest clogging the rain spout. Later 
he jimmied off the wooden frame hanging over the basement door, which 
took some time. The wood was rotting and rainwater was seeping into the 
basement’s walls and onto the floor. Meg stayed at her piano. Wallace passed 
her in her piano room as he left the house an hour later, calling out, 
“I’m going to Home Depot to buy caulk.” He came directly home fifteen minutes 
later and caulked the gaps he’d made where he’d removed the door frame. | © Lisa Weiss
