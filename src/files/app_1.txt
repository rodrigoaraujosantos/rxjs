One dry afternoon at the height of the salmonfly hatch
 in a cabin overlooking the Snake River
a real estate developer named Chevy Randolph ate psilocybin mushrooms for the fourth time in his life. Though he had always considered the dried mushrooms themselves foul on the palette
Randolph found it oddly comforting that the cabin’s owner
an enormous bearded semi-pro rugby coach from Seattle
commented that they reminded him of lichen
and treated them in a dessicator next to slabs of elk jerky. When it came to olfactory setting
it would be hard to beat the combination of game
earth and cedar that diffused throughout the cabin and out onto the porch. In between rounds of spinning records with his companions
and shooting wobble from the porch over the heads of applauding
flinching raft-paddlers in the gorge below
Chevy Randolph came to the conclusion that he had been taking the wrong approach to commuting. His entire professional career had been to entice the well-heeled to sleep somewhere else
that elsewhere being predicated on a city’s current neighborhoods
borders
county lines and country-club status. Some cities had well-established bedroom communities which his developments merely enhanced and expanded
while in others he identified lots bereft of transportation options and spun them as an ideal compromise to those who could afford not only a three- or four-pointed star to adorn the grill of a sedan
but also a punctual man to climb downstairs at dawn from his rent-controlled railroad apartment
kindle the engine and warm the seats. | © Benjamin Smith
